# MSE-calculator
A basic MSE calculator 
This project allows you to calculate the mse value. All you have to do is enter the data you have in the "y_true" section and enter the data your model predicts in the "y_predict" section.

y_true = []                # Corret Data 
y_predict =[]              #Predict Data
